# Question

How much money goes into subsidizing private developers to build "affordable housing" --including direct subsidies and tax breaks. And how many units of affordable housing does this generate?

## Feasibility

Why is this research question relevant/important? 
Housing and affordable housing are extremely interconnected with the criminal justice system and can shape rehabilitation outcomes. The racism that we see in policing can also be seen in historical and contemporary housing injustice. 

What kind of data/records would help to answer the request?
There are records for where public money is spent somewhere so records from the bodies that control and distribute these funds would be helpful.

What kind of work do you think will need to be done to answer the request? 
Finding data links and compiling individual information into a larger spreadsheet

How long do you think it will take?
Could take 1-2 weeks or more depending on how specific the records are and what Jackie Smith wants from them. 

Based on the above, do you think the question is feasible?
Yes I think it is feasible – I am not sure if it will be completely comprehensive and totally encompassing because there could be other things out there that I couldn’t find. 

## Analysis/research/steps completed

- I spent about 2-3 hours researching affordable housing in Allegheny County. I found some information from city council about what developers are supposed to do in terms of the mandated number of affordable housing units but that doesn’t mean that those are the actual numbers of affordable housing available/being made. 
- I found resources about funds under the PA Housing Financing Agency. The dataset has 132 pages worth of data by municipality about the property name, management, subsidy, occupancy and units.  (https://www.phfa.org/forms/multifamily_inventory/dv_allegheny.pdf )

## Response

I finished transferring all of the data into a spreadsheet. I added more sheets for research on the owners and the property managers. I also have a sheet to be used for some basic statistics that will answer some of Jackie’s other questions based on the data. 

The average cost per unit unit is $13,332.66. The total amount spent was $126,733,342.00. Out of all the properties that get LIHTC (182 properties) in 2023, only 29 are Permanent Supportive Housing. 15 properties are 55+ and 46 are 62+ which means about 33.5% of all properties that receive LIHTC are for seniors (55+ and 62+).
