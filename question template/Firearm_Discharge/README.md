# Question
> Are there numbers of total firearm discharges by county?

## Feasibility
Not feasible due to the lack of access to publicly available data on gunshots in the county. However, local data on the City of Pittsburgh exists.

## Analysis/research/steps completed
Sweeping searches through existing databases, publicly available raw data, and similar reports

## Response

The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) and the Allegheny County Department of Human Services (DHS) create dashboards such as the one below that reports data on shots fired from 2012 onward in the city of Pittsburgh. It collects the data from 911 dispatches and can be broken down by year/month and by neighborhood. However, since there is no data county-wide (only within the City of Pittsburgh), and since 911 dispatches for the entire county are not public data, we are not able to replicate this project for the entire county.
It's worth noting this recent article from Wired (see below) about some leaked locations of ShotSpotter, which includes many in the Pittsburgh area. ShotSpotter leads to many false alarms, so it may not be a good source of firearm discharges.
