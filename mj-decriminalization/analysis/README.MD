2015-2020 JW | Initial files from Jesse Wozniak, paraphrasing: This was collected and cleaned up by an undergrad volunteer. This only goes from 2015 (the year the ordinance was passed) through 2020. New data would need to be cleaned up before being added in. The Tran et al article is from the journal of drug and alcohol dependence examining Philadelphia's decriminalization ordinance.
