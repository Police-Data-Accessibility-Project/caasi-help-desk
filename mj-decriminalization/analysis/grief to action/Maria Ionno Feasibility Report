# Question
> After marijuana was decriminalized in Pittsburgh, we are hearing reports that police now have a choiceâ€”give people a citation under Pittsburgh law, or arrest under Allegheny County and PA State law. Are there demographic differences in who is being cited vs. arrested for marijuana possession? 

## Feasibility
Why is this research question relevant/important? 
This data collection has the ability to highlight how different demographics could possibly affect whether a person is arrested rather than cited for marijuana possession. Examining this data will help us better understand if there are certain demographics of people that are disproportionately affected by the decriminalization of marijuana in Pittsburgh.  

What kind of data/records would help to answer the request?
I was provided with data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center on the amount of marijuana related arrests and citations in the city of Pittsburgh from 2015 to 2022.

How long do you think it will take?
This project should take three to four weeks. I will have to learn how to analyze the data through the programming language Python and then create visualizations to display the different patterns within the data. 

What kind of work do you think will need to be done to answer the request? 
I will need to create a Google Collab notebook in order to utilize Python to analyze the data. 

Based on the above, do you think the question is feasible?
I do think this question is feasible.  

## Analysis/research/steps completed
I began by creating a Google Collab Notebook in order to examine and analyze the data using the Python coding langauge. The notebook I created is attached below.
