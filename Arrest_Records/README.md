# Question
Types of Arrest by Police Force or Municipality in Allegheny County
## Feasibility
The question of arrest records by police force or municipality is an important question to analyze in order to see what trends are present for example, if certain communities are having higher arrest rates than others. Resources in order to answer the question already exist such as arrest records in the City of Pittsburgh provided by The Western Regional Data Center. Another resource is The Crime Data Explorer by The Federal Bureau of Investigations. To see all the municipalities in Allegheny County resources are available on the county's website. In order to answer the question, combing through data would be needed to see which municipalities have arrest records available. If certain municipalities do not have records available this would need to be noted as well. If all the data is available by agencies it can be done within a month with reasonable effort. Finding if agencies have available data will be the most time consuming part, if the data is not available a request may need to be made.
