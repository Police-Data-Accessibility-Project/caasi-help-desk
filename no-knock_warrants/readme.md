# Question
> Following the passage of Breonna’s Law banning no-knock warrants, is there data on warrants to confirm compliance?

## Feasibility
Warrants are not publicly available data, according to the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office, so not feasible to determine whether warrants executed since the passage of the law are in compliance.

## Analysis/research/steps completed
Called various clerks at the Allegheny County Court House
> including but not limited to: the Department of Records, clerk of Court Records, Warrant clerk, Pretrial Services, Criminal Division, and others.

Called the Sheriff's Office (412-350-4700) and was told was told that they do not have the physical warrants, but they do keep records of them. However, this is not public information and is only kept internally for law enforcement. The only suggestion was that the public could search for specific cases through public records.

## Response
If warrant records were public, we could take a look at the warrants to try to determine whether they were executed properly according to Breonna’s Law (that is, law enforcement announces themselves and their purpose, waits a certain amount of time before entering, wears proper attire that makes it clear they are law enforcement, turn body cameras on, and so on). Ensuring compliance with the law is extremely important for public safety, as no-knock warrants are dangerous for all involved.
However, the Sheriff's Office revealed the public does not have access to warrants.

Other Information:
> According to the [Allegheny County jail roster](https://alleghenycountyjailroster.org/sheriff-arrest-warrants/): “Allegheny County Warrant Lookup: Individuals can perform an Allegheny County Warrant lookup through the Sheriff's Office. This service allows the public to search for active warrants online, ensuring transparency and public safety.”
>- Note: this is to search for a specific person, to see whether they have an outstanding warrant, not a record of it, and so one would need to know the personal information of the person to look them up
