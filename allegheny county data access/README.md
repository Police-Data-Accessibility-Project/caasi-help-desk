# Policy Brief: Analyzing and improving Allegheny County data access

This policy brief was created after a group of students were interested in researching emergency police response to mental health crisis. They quickly determined that such research was impossible given the lack of available data, despite rumors of alternative response programs being piloted at the local and county level.

In response, the group decided to make a policy brief to advocate for the kind of data that would facilitate analysis by future researchers.
