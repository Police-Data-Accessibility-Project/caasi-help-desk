## Response
1. What is accreditation?

According to the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) [COPS office](https://cops.usdoj.gov/LEA_accreditation) (Community Oriented Policing Services), “Law enforcement agency (LEA) accreditation is a self-initiated process of adopting and maintaining standardized policies and procedures. LEAs operate within a specific set of state- and/or nationally recognized standards that are determined and defined by an accreditation body. To obtain accreditation, an LEA must work with a state or national accreditation body to develop and adopt a specific set of operational standards -the number of standards varies by accreditation entity – and maintain compliance during the accreditation period”

They state that a main benefit of this is “to ensure accountability and transparency that can enhance confidence and trust in law enforcement among the communities they serve”

“Accreditation is a progressive and time-proven way of helping institutions evaluate and improve their overall performance. The cornerstone of this strategy lies in the promulgation of standards containing a clear statement of professional objectives. Participating administrators then conduct a thorough analysis to determine how existing operations can be adapted to meet these objectives. When the procedures are in place, a team of independent professionals is assigned to verify that all applicable standards have been successfully implemented. The process culminates with a decision by an authoritative body that the institution is worthy of accreditation.” [(Source)](https://pcpa.memberclicks.net/accreditation-home)

According to the PCPA (Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Association), it seems that accreditation is meant as an internal benefit rather than a means for the community to hold police accountable (ex: under the [‘benefits’](https://pcpa.memberclicks.net/accreditation-home) section it lists one of the benefits as “reduces agency risk and exposure to lawsuits”)

2. When was the City of Pittsburgh Accredited?

According to the PCPA, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police was [accredited](https://pcpa.memberclicks.net/accredited-agencies) on **1/10/2013** by the Pennsylvania Law Enforcement Accreditation Commission (PLEAC) which was developed by the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police in 2001

Not accredited by the CALEA (Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies), which is a different organization (see [here](https://www.calea.org/about-us) for more information), according to their 2022 annual [report](https://7a140732.flowpaper.com/CALEAAR2022final/#page=24)

3. Summary of what would have to happen to get re-accredited

According to the PCPA [website](https://pcpa.memberclicks.net/enrollment), “accreditation status will remain valid for a three-year period with annual reports required”

*“there is a $1,000 annual program maintenance fee for agencies whose Chief is an Active Member of PCPA.   For all others, the annual program maintenance fee is $1,250.  This annual fee does not apply until you become an accredited agency.  This fee is necessary to help defray the direct costs of your subsequent re-accreditation on-site assessments”* (from [FAQ page](https://pcpa.memberclicks.net/faq-s))

In July 2022, WESA published an [article](https://www.wesa.fm/2022-07-01/pittsburgh-police-accreditation-threatened-by-law-to-scale-back-traffic-stops) summarizing how Pittsburgh police were threatened by PLEAC that their accreditation would be revoked. The reason was that the City of Pittsburgh passed an ordinance that prohibited police from pulling over motorists for minor infractions like a broken brake light, but PLEAC claimed this violated PA’s vehicle code. Essentially, PLEAC said the City of Pittsburgh could not override PA’s vehicle code, and this ordinance did that, so PLEAC threatened revocation of the accreditation (for violating their policy of following all state and federal law, including state vehicle codes).

The ordinance was originally passed as a response to disproportionate enforcement against POC, due to racial bias by police.

Another [article](https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2023-01-12/pittsburgh-police-resume-secondary-traffic-stops-despite-city-ordinance-against-them) published by WESA in January 2023 said that the accreditation agency ultimately decided against revoking accreditation (It says: “According to Jim Adams, accreditation coordinator for the chiefs association, Pittsburgh was granted a waiver through 2025. He said that while following the ordinance runs afoul of the accreditation standards, “it was no fault of the police department or the police chief.”). However, the Pittsburgh police department decided to no longer abide by the ordinance, citing officers’ inability to properly do their jobs.
