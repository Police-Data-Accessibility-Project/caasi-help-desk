# CAASI x PDAP data help desk
This represents the results of an experimental partnership between the Police Data Accessibility Project ([PDAP](https://pdap.io)) and the Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh ([CAASI](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/)). A multidisciplinary group of students works to answer questions from elected officials and advocates in Pittsburgh.
