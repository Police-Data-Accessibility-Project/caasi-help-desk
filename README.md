# CAASI x PDAP data help desk
This represents the results of an experimental partnership between the Police Data Accessibility Project ([PDAP](https://pdap.io)) and the Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh ([CAASI](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/)). A multidisciplinary group of students works to answer questions from elected officials and advocates in Pittsburgh.

## Navigating this repository
Each folder represents a community question. Start with any folder's README and explore from there.

# First-time volunteers

## Orientation (10–20 minutes)
Here are some things to check out / understand before you get started:
1. To learn more about PDAP, [start here](https://pdap.io/). Try out the search function! See what it's like to make a request!
2. Familiarize yourself with the [terms we use](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/terms-and-definitions) and look at some [examples of different record types](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy).
3. Sign up as a volunteer at PDAP [with our docs](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/contribute).
4. Look at some open requests [using this project](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/26/views/1).
5. Poke around this repository to see some past student work.

## Get started (1–2 hours)
To get familiar with the project, try some of our basic volunteer tasks!
1. Using [this doc as a guide](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/contribute/submit-data-sources), find an agency in the area. Try to find as many sources of data about the agency as you can.
2. Spend an hour [labeling potential data sources](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/contribute/data-source-annotation).

## Respond to requests (1+ hours)
You may be working on a request alone or in a group.
1. Initialize the project
  - Add a new folder with a README based on the template.
  - Make a commit with the README and folder.
  - Open a draft pull request for the work in progress. Use the phrase `"fixes #\<issue number>"` in the body of the PR.
2. Make comments on the request issue asking questions or making updates as needed.
3. Make commits to the request's branch as you work; they will show up on the draft PR as you push them to GitHub.
4. When the response is ready for review, request a review from others on the project.

### New to GitHub?
GitHub is for storing code-related files and projects. It's great for open-source collaboration and development, because it helps us with version control over time. You can [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) so you have a version on your computer for tinkering. If you make improvements, you can submit them for approval. We recommend using [GitHub desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) if you're new to GitHub and want to contribute.

# Findings
PDAP is assisting with the execution of this research project by providing data, tools, and access, but does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of its findings.

# Meta-learnings from the first cohort
We ran a pilot of the data help desk from about November 2023 to April 2024. We examined the effectiveness of the experiment to make this program more effective over time.

- Visibility on work in progress
   - Participants did not publish anything until it was "final", so there was no opportunity for feedback or iteration.
   - Work is not graded, so transparency can be the default. We'll start response by creating a README and a **draft pull request** for each response.
 - Collaboration
   - Participants exclusively worked alone, so we did not benefit from the group being multidisciplinary.
   - We will treat questions as our **collective responsibility by default**, with room for individual contributions on tasks.
 - Use of time
   - Our meetings were exclusively used for Python training; this was important, but we missed the opportunity to hear and learn from each other.
   - The first agenda item for working meetings is stand-up style progress updates where we **show each other our work**.
 - Project management
   - We used Airtable, but participants had read-only access; they did not have enough agency to make changes.
   - We're using **GitHub for PM**; participants will become familiar with it through issues, and gradually gain submission skills.
 - Word count and hierarchy
   - Students are used to hitting word counts; 5-minute feasibility exercises turned into multi-page written reports, and request responses sometimes missed the forest for the trees.
   - In the real world, **being concise is its own important skill**. We'll edit each other's responses and set max word counts so that details are available only when needed.
