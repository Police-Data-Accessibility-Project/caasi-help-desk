# CAASI x PDAP data help desk
This represents the results of an experimental partnership between the Police Data Accessibility Project ([PDAP](https://pdap.io)) and the Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh ([CAASI](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/)). 

A multidisciplinary group of students assembled to analyze questions from elected officials and advocates about police systems in Pittsburgh. The group worked through questions by assessing feasibility, locating helpful sources of data, and performing data analysis using skills acquired in a weekly Python workshop.
